## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I decided to change things up in a few different ways for this project.

The first thing I did differently was that I did not use the images completely as they were. I noticed that the images given all had preset colors, based on the background color of its category. I didn't think this was very flexible if the user wanted a new background color or a different image, so I configured images to use a combination of CSS filters so that they instead dark the area of the background they are on. This allows them to be a tint of the background, like their original color, while allowing it to be flexible enough to use any image on any background while keeping it looking good.

### Continued development
